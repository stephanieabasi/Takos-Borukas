Takos Borukas is an amazing authentic Mexican restaurant with a 4.7-star rating. We decided to reach out Takos Borukas to make a website for our project. Takos Borukas did not originally have a website, so this was a great opportunity to help their business be known.
--------------------------------------------------------
Challenges were making the website responsive to all devices. We would fix something on iPhone dimensions but then when you went back, it changed the desktop dimensions format. We did figure it out by using media query. Time was also a challenge because we started making this in November 2021 and finished December 10th, 21.
--------------------------------------------------------
This website's features:
    - A logo in the navbar that when clicked on will lead you to the homepage
    
    - An order page for online orders. There is a button with the phone number that will direct you to the Takos Borukas' phone number
    
    - A google maps on the order page for customers to view Takos Borukas location and see the distance they will need to drive to get there. It also gives customers directions on how to get to the restaurant

    -On the homepage, it gives Takos Borukas' most ordered dishes. When you click on the picture it directs you to the dish on the menu

    -It features Takos Borukas full menu including their prices.

    -Thereâ€™s is a page navigation on each page of the Entrees part of the menu.

    -Our client asked for the website to have the colors and look like the menu, so we executed it.
--------------------------------------------------------
We hope you enjoy this website and have your business grow!

    Sincerely, Stephanie and Claudia
